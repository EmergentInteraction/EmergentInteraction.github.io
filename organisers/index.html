      <h1>Emergent Interaction:</h1>

<h2 class="subtitle">Committee</h2>



<p><span class="newthought">Our organising committee brings together a broad international group with backgrounds in HCI, control theory, enactivist cognitive science, linguistics and computational interaction.</span></p>

<p><strong>Daniel Bennett</strong>
is a PhD researcher at Bristol Interaction Group with Oussama Metatla and Anne Roudaut. His PhD work focuses on applying dynamical-systems methods from 4E cognitive science to understand technology use. He is also interested in generative dynamical systems models for musical interaction.</p>

<p><strong>Feng Feng</strong> is a Research Associate at University of Eastern Finland and Microsurgery centre in Kuopio University Hospital. She has a background in both Industrial Design and Cognitive Science. Her interests include embodied cognition, multi-sensory perception, Human-Computer-Interaction and Human-Robot-Interaction, and the development of multi-sensory technologies.</p>

<p><strong>Alan Dix</strong> is an author, researcher, and university professor, specialising in human–computer interaction. Dix is currently the Director of the Computational Foundry at Swansea University, Wales. A mathematician by training, his work has included applying formal methods and statistics in HCI as well as many other areas including creativity and physical design. His research methods can be eclectic including walking a thousand miles around Wales to understand mobile connectivity and community technology.</p>

<p><strong>Parisa Eslambolchilar</strong>
 is currently a Reader in Human–Computer Interaction (HCI) at Cardiff University and leads the Complex Systems Research Group and the Human Factors Technology Research Priority Area at the School.
Her research interests include HCI, ubiquitous computing, and designing interactive systems to support self-reflection, self-monitoring, feedback (audio, haptic, visual, and soma), 
persuasion, immersion, and navigation. Her work exploits the Internet of things, wearables, smartphones, augmented reality, and virtual reality.</p>

<p><strong>Tom Froese</strong>
is head of Head of Okinawa’s Embodied Cognitive Science Unit. A cognitive scientist with a background in computer science and complex systems, he applies diverse methods to investigate the interactive basis of life and mind. He is particularly known for his contributions in artificial life and the enactive approach to cognitive science.</p>

<p><strong>Vassilis Kostakos</strong> is Professor of Human-Computer Interaction at University of Melbourne. His research interests include ubiquitous computing (Ubicomp), human-computer interaction (HCI), social computing, Internet of Things.</p>

<p><strong>Sébastien Lerique</strong> is a Postdoctoral Scholar in cognitive science at Okinawa’s Embodied Cognitive Science Unit, with interests in the role of embodiment in interactions, complex systems, and the emergence of language.</p>

<p><strong>Niels van Berkel</strong> is an Assistant Professor at the Human-Centered Computing Group (HCC) at Aalborg University. His research interests lay in Human-Computer Interaction, Social Computing, and Ubiquitous Computing. In particular, he has focused on self-report studies, crowdsourcing, and Human-AI interaction.</p>
