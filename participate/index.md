## Call for Participation

The study of Complex Dynamical Systems is a topic of growing importance across human centred disciplines, from economics and sociology to psychology and healthcare. The theories and methods of Complexity Science are driving significant progress in the understanding of a wide range of phenomena in which relationships and interactions between components are important. The goal of this workshop is to begin a discussion on the contribution these techniques can make in HCI, both methodological and theoretical.

Potential participants should submit a 4 to 8 page long position paper (including references), in the CHI Extended Abstracts Format, that addresses at least one of the key topic(s)of the workshop. The paper should also include a statement on the potential goals of their research and the problem(s) it aims to address. Please read our workshop proposal paper (above) for more information. Submission will be via EasyChair, with information on this provided soon. contact [complexity.chi@gmail.com](mailto:complexity.chi@gmail.com) for more information.

We will select papers based on relevance, quality, and diversity. At least one author of each accepted position paper must attend the workshop and all participants must register for both the workshop and for at least one day of the conference. 

## Key Topics


- Application of methods and approaches from complexity science and dynamical systems theory to problems in HCI

- Drawing connections between existing HCI approaches and accounts in complexity theory, dynamical systems and enactivism

- Applications of Control Theory and other dynamical approaches to help understand users and design systems

- Discussion of what HCI can learn from recent work on dynamical and enactivist approaches to cognitive science

- Methodological or theoretical contributions from complexity theory, dynamical systems theory, drawn from other disciplines, such as control theory, enactivist cognitive science, computational social science

- Issues raised by the application of complexity methods in HCI

- Software and other tools to support researchers in applying complexity methods in HCI
