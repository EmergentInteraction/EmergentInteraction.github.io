<p>There is a long tradition of work in Human Computer Interaction which emphasises the specifically <em>interactive</em> elements of interaction behaviour. This work emphasises the way behaviour arises from ongoing adaptation, and the dynamically varying relationships between interacting elements - the human(s) and the technology(ies), as well as other humans and aspects of the environment. Researchers have used concepts as diverse as affordances, situated-ness, phenomenology, and control theory to understand these situations in which the direction of influence goes both ways. Just as human behaviour moulds and manipulates technology and environment, those same technologies and environments simultaneously condition human behaviour.</p>

<p>Recent work in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) has framed this old question in a new way - suggesting that interaction is well modelled as a <em>complex dynamical system</em>. This approach brings the tools and concepts of Complexity Science to bear on familiar, but tricky, questions of interactivity and context. In doing so, it points to a range of new theoretical perspectives, modelling techniques, and other quantitative methods. These have the potential to enrich our understanding of interaction across many scales - from moment-to-moment system control, through patterns of engagement, to the behaviours of organisations and social networks. Among other issues, complexity approaches may contribute a new precision to our understanding of embodiment in interaction. Since HCI first drew on ideas of embodiment and enactivism these fields have developed considerably, embracing dynamical and complexity methods and increasingly sophisticated theoretical accounts. There is now an opportunity for HCI to re-engage with ongoing work in these areas and benefit from the new methods and perspectives developing there.</p>

<p>This workshop will investigate the contributions which complexity science can bring to HCI. Our organising committee brings together voices from HCI, Control Theory, and Enactivist Cognitive Science, alongside younger researchers. We welcome participation from researchers from these and any other disciplines whose work addresses the key topics of the workshop (below). Attendees will have a chance to present brief introductions to their own interests and positions, before engaging in guided discussions, which will inform a final panel discussion, drawing together the themes of the day.</p>

<p><em>Potential participants should submit a 4 to 8 page long position paper (including references), in the CHI Extended Abstracts Format, that addresses at least one of the key topic(s)of the workshop. The paper should also include a statement on the potential goals of their research and the problem(s) it aims to address. Please read our workshop proposal paper for more information. <strong>TODO</strong> Submit to  complexity.chi@gmail.com</em></p>
