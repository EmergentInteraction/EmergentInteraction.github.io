Workshop document coming soon

There is a long tradition in HCI of work which emphasises the specifically *interactive* elements of interaction with technology. This work has focused on the way that behaviour arises out of ongoing adaptation, and dynamically varying relationships between the elements involved - human, technology, other humans and other elements in the environment. Researchers have used concepts as diverse as affordances, situated-ness, phenomenology, and control theory to understand the way that influences in interaction go both ways. Just as human behaviour moulds and manipulates technology and environment, those same technologies and environments simultaneously condition human behaviour.


Recent work in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) has framed this old question in a new way - suggesting that interaction is well modelled as a *complex dynamical system*. This approach brings the tools and concepts of Complexity Science to bear on familiar, but tricky, questions of interactivity and context. In doing so, it points to a range of new theoretical perspectives, modelling techniques, and quantitative methods which can enrich our understanding of interaction across many scales - from moment-to-moment system control, through patterns of engagement, to the behaviours of organisations and social networks. Among other issues, complexity approaches may contribute to our understanding of embodiment in interaction. Since HCI first drew on ideas of embodiment and enactivism these fields have developed considerably, embracing dynamical and complexity methods. There is now an opportunity for HCI to re-engage with ongoing work in these areas and benefit from the new methods and perspectives developing there.

This workshop will investigate the contributions complexity science can bring to HCI. Our organising committee brings together voices from HCI, Control Theory, and Enactivist Cognitive Science, alongside younger researchers. We welcome participation from researchers in these and any relevant fields, with an interest in the key topics of the workshop (below). Attendees will present brief introductions to their own interests with issues of complexity, and then engage in guided discussions, leading to a final panel discussion with Q&A, drawing together the themes of the day. 


*Potential participants should submit a 4 to 8 page long position paper (including references), in the CHI Extended Abstracts Format, that addresses at least one of the key topic(s)of the workshop. The paper should also include a statement on the potential goals of their research and the problem(s) it aims to address. Submit to  complexity.chi@gmail.com*
