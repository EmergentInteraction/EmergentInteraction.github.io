Crumpsall Biscuit Works (CWS) Warehouse at Avonmouth

<em>Crumpsall Biscuit Works opened in Lower Crumpsall, near Manchester, in around 1873. The factory was subject to numerous alterations and expansions between around 1896 and the 1920s, including plans for a new cake bakery which were laid down in 1896, there was a new biscuit portion added in 1896, and in 1921 additional land was purchased to accommodate extensions such as new offices, a despatch room and a garage.
[...]
The works at Crumpsall boasted being “the only 8 hour day biscuit works in England” and had numerous facilities for its employees including a cricket club; football club; tennis courts; a bowling green; a recreation ground; a dining room for over 600 people with discounted refreshments and free warming of packed dinners; a library; and board and card games. The works put on numerous social events through the year including sports days, and dances and whist drives nearly every week during the winter. The works also stated that girls, however young, were started at no less than 6 shillings a week, and that they were only employed to do girls work and not to save the expense of employing men. There was also a Sick Benefit Society.</em>

<em>
    Increase of light and increase of labour have always gone hand in hand. If today, when our gaze is no longer able to penetrate the pale reflected glow over the city and its environs, we think back to the eighteenth century, it hardly seems possible that even then, before the Industrial age, a great number of people, at least in some places, spent their lives with their wretched bodies strapped to looms made of wooden frames and rails, hung with weights and reminiscent of torture or cages. It was a peculiar symbiosis which, perhaps because of its relatively primitive character makes more apparent than any later form of factory work that we are able to maintain ourselves on this earth only by being harnessed to the machines we have invented. That weavers in particular[...] tended to suffer from melancholy and all the evils associated with it, is understandable given the nature of their work, which forced them to sit bent over, day after day, straining to keep their eye on the complex patterns they created. It is difficult to imagine the depths of despair into which those can be driven who, even after the end of the working day, are engrossed in their intricate designs and who are pursued, even into their dreams, by the feeling that they have got hold of the wrong thread.</em>

<em>    Li Hua makes a living playing computer games. Working from a cramped office in the heart of Changsha, China, he slays dragons and loots virtual gold in 10-hour shifts. Next to him, rows of other young workers do the same. “It is just like working in a factory, the only difference is that this is the virtual world,” says Li. “The working conditions are hard. We don’t get weekends off and I only have one day free a month. But compared to other jobs it is good. I have no other skills and I enjoy playing sometimes.”
    [...]
    For thousands of Chinese workers such as Li, “gold farming” is a way of life. Workers can expect to earn between £80-£120 a month which, given the long hours and night shifts, can amount to as little as 30p an hour. After completing his shift, Li is given a basic meal of rice, meat and vegetables and falls into a bunk bed in a room that eight other gold farmers share. His wages may be low, but food and accommodation are included.
    [...] “Gold farming appears to be anything but a here today, gone tomorrow blip,” says Heeks. “In fact, gold farming may be a glimpse into a much larger future of international, network-based development where life, work and commerce become ever more immersed in cyberspace. We could be seeing, in short, the emergence of ‘development 2.0?.”</em>

    back in the days of the “real” google updates, when I would sit at my comoputer for 24-48 hours straight checking things out, I would often dream about algos and linking patterns. It’s not real pleasant :)

    When I was studying C++, I woke up one morning extremely distressed that I hadn’t had time to call the destructer before waking up.

    Way back when, in assembler programming, I would have to place the address of the code I was exiting in register 14. Then, when ready to come back and resume that code, the program would ‘branch to register 14?, thereby returning to the place it left. I once woke up to use the toilet, and upon getting there realized I forgot to load register 14 with the address of my bed. I though I was stuck</em>
